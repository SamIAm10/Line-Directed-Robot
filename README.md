# Line-Directed-Robot
Code for a 2-wheeled line-following robot (written in Atmel Studio).

The robot used is the Sparkfun Redbot, found [here](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12649).
It uses three IR sensors in the front, and has two motorized wheels. The entire code for the project is contained within "redbot_new". The "main.c" code can be modified to change the speed, sensitivity, and other factors of the robot.
