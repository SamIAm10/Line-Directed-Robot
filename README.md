# Line-Directed Robot
Code for a 2-wheeled line-following robot (written in Atmel Studio).

The robot used is the Sparkfun Redbot, found [here](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12649).
It uses three IR sensors in the front to follow a line of black tape, and has two motorized wheels for directional control. The entire code for the project is contained within "redbot_new". The "main.c" code can be modified to change the speed, sensitivity, and other factors of the robot. This project requires installation of "avrdude". Can be opened in Atmel Studio through "redbot_new.atsln".
